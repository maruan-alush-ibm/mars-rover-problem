# mars-rover-problem

A repo for my solution to the Mars Rover problem.

## How to run the code:

1. Open the HTML file in your chosen browser and use the alert box to fill in the answers and then use the developer tools to look at the console for the output
2. Run the code from index.js in an online tool such as Repl.it

### Please note: This code will only run in a browser environment e.g. NOT NodeJS
